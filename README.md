# DenialAppealSystem
 
Trying to make this a bit less complicated..

Because the classes we create will require the jar files for each class, I've created a makefile for the project.
In order to run the makefile on a windows system, you will need to do the following:

1. Install the chocolatey package manager for Windows (this will allow you to use Linux commands in your Windows Terminal)
2. Run choco install make

I promise, this is the absolutely last thing you will have to download, and you may even use it long term since you're a fan of the terminal.
