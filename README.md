# Denial Appeal System
 
A medical billing specialist often has multiple responsibilities that inhibit their ability to address individual claim denials. They are often the single patient advocate ensuring that health insurance claims are appropriately considered and approved by the insurance company. Because insurance company policies and CMS guidelines can change annually, denials are a regular occurrence that must be handled within a timely manner set by the insurance company. Since physician group and hospital sizes can vary, daily denials can range anywhere from dozens to hundreds that must be considered and processed by the billing specialist. By streamlining the appeal letter process, our group has the goal of easing the burden of the billing specialist so that they can continue to effectively advocate on behalf of the patient and physician to ensure medical procedures are covered by insurance companies.  

The functionality of this software includes:
* Allowing the User to login to the system and displaying an error if the connection cannot be established.
* Displaying a list of all the current insurance claim denials for the user to select.
*	Displaying the patient information so that the user can assess whether a new appeal reason should be created. 
*	Allowing the user to either select a pre-generated appeal reason or create their own.
*	Allowing the user to choose whether to save the appeal reason into the database for future use.
*	Allowing the user to determine whether the denial was reasonable and set the claim status to patient responsibility if the patient is responsible for any outstanding balance.
*	Update the claim status to ‘appeal sent’ if an appeal was generated.
*	Generate an appeal letter to send to the insurance company. 

By using this software, a company can:
*	Increase revenue for the Medical Group
*	Reduce procedure write offs from timely filing or timely appeal denials
*	Increase ability to determine patterns impacting claim approvals
*	Increase appeal letter determination efficiency
*	Allow for more effective patient service advocacy
*	Allow the billing specialist more time to focus on their other responsibilities
